                designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as

            <h3>What is JavaScript</h3>
            <small>Posted on Mar 21</small>
            <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to 
                the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, 
                and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
                object-orientation, and first-class functions.
